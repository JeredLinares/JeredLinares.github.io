Long post, but this is my way of posting the <a href="https://youtu.be/Yx5mAd8wiNU"> Captain Janeway meme </a> in a professional context after seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/eojeh9SKtsI"> a racist video of a man doing hard work in high heat in the middle of a pandemic and being accosted. </a>

I generally try not to share this side of my experiences, because the culture of business requires us to broadcast positives and only speak negatives behind closed doors. This was alien to me before the MBA. As an, engineer and scientist, I was trained that only sharing the best data would lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/us/bridge-collapse-florida-international-university-NTSB.html"> bridge collapses</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/health/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-fraud.html"> faulty technology</a>. Then as a doctor, I was trained and compelled by medical ethics to always provide <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/informed-consent"> informed consent </a> which meant providing all the evidence around risks, benefits, and alternatives. However, in my MBA program, I remember being taught in my leadership class how to use <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/framing-effect/"> framing</a> and <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/50-cognitive-biases-in-the-modern-world/> cognitive biases</a> to both recognize how I might be affected by them and how to use them to reach my ends. I explicitly remember my professor saying, “use these to your advantage.”

Further, I remember being taught “perception is reality.” Specifically, increasing the cost of a branded drug above the cost of the same generic drug, to a noticeably higher price, will allow someone with a headache to feel that they are receiving a better product. Here, the moto is play to the strengths. This nuanced because it is not wrong, but there is a large grey zone between not sharing relevant negative information intentionally and prioritizing positive data and running out of space to share the downsides. Or more often, it seems to fall to the other party to ask about the negatives. I do not expect anyone to ever ask me, “ can you share your experiences being a person of color?” Though if asked, I would gladly share. So instead, I am going against the culture of business and sharing the uncomfortable story.

A year ago, I would have just posted the video that upset me this morning to Facebook and moved on with my day. However, I remember making a promise to myself when I finalized my MBA program choice. I promised myself that I would advocate for the people who come from where I come from, look like me, and are equally, if not more, talented, but because of lack of opportunity are not in the rooms I get invited to. That promise has been harder to keep than I expected, and I don’t expect that I will always have the sonority or be in a position to advocate, but today I am. I have been inspired by people such as Dr. Kameron Matthews and Erika Brown who speak confidently one these topics. I still have a rule that I am only allowed to post or like 1DEI item a week so that my network continues to see me as a doctor and MBA instead of just a social justice warrior; which can sometimes be a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-06-29/rules-of-working-on-wall-street-from-black-employees-who-lived-it"> negative in elite professions</a>.

The story I want to share surrounds an experience after my acceptance to my MBA program. When I decided to come to this program, I had an extended conversation with my sister who applied to MBA programs at the same time I applied and interviewed at some of the top programs, just like I did. For background, we grew up together in Cicero, IL a Midwest town with a current demographic break down of 90.8% Latino residents and a median annual income for a male of $31,603 or $15.19/hr and a poverty rate of 18.3% and a high school with a great schools rating of 1/10. We are the exception in building elite careers regardless of the circumstances of our birth. However, I will be the first to admit that I can name at least five people off the top of my head and many more if I thought deeply who were harder working and more intelligent than me, but simply out of a lack of opportunity to capitalize on those qualities, they are not at the tables I sit at. When my sister and I finalized our choices for MBA programs, she asked me, “are you sure you will be happy there? I wouldn’t be.” I admitted to her that I wasn’t going to my program to be happy, but for the doors that it could open for me.

Her intuition was correct even before the first day of classes. I wanted to get some branded shirts and hats for my parents, so I visited the bookstore. I was wearing normal summer street cloths ( this shouldn’t matter, but for context I share it ) and as I am walking through the aisles with pride in my accomplishment and excitement about sharing it with my family, and a t-shirt and a hat in my hands, a person comes up to me and asks me if I have any more of a particular mug in stock. I initially pretended not to hear him, but he came closer and repeated his question. I looked at him sternly and coldly said, “I don’t work here.” He apologized, moved on, and likely does not remember me, but he is someone I will never forget. He and others like him have stolen an enormous amount of my mental bandwidth over my MBA education.

I am sharing this post because in my experience; my classmates, administrators, and professors are good people. They have been kind and I know that they consider us as part of the same group. I don’t think they are racist. However, many are unaware of why some find frustration with the amount of privilege that they were born with and, until recently, they did the same as everyone, focused on their goals and worked hard to achieve them. I respect all of my peers and recognize that they work hard and are generous people. I share this to educate allies who want to understand better.

What I want, ironically, is something that I burn away on my own. Time.

I woke up at 5:30am this morning and I was excited about working on a valuation model which I felt confident I could show as some of my best work and a reason why my summer internship should hire me full time. However, as I scroll through my newsfeed and drink my green tea, I see <a href="https://nbcpalmsprings.com/2020/07/17/rancho-mirage-woman-demands-immigration-papers-from-landscaper/"> the news story<a>. It upsets me and I mentally catalog it next to the times I was questioned at a front desk while the other doctors I was with were not, next to the story of a man killed in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/nyregion/21immigrant.html"> “beaner hopping,”</a> next to the story of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/us/el-paso-shooting.html">  Walmart shooting</a> which happened just after my incident at the book store, and so many others. 

      <br / >

I had two choices at that point. I could compartmentalize it, agreeing with myself that I have bigger priorities and as I will never forget from Erika Brown, “be a rock star first.” Or I could fulfill my promise to myself and speak for those who are not at the tables I sit at. This is me working to fulfill my promise to myself and this post is for Juan Andrade who looks just like me and who I have no doubt is just as smart and clearly harder working than me. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/06/18/education-meritocracy-report-finds-it-is-still-better-be-born-rich-than-smart-us/"> Likely, the only difference between us that I had opportunities to show my talent</a>.

With regard to education of allies, I want allies to understand that I constantly use more mental bandwidth than I need to, with questions which exist only in my own head. “If I don’t do well here, they will assume that I am just a diversity hire.” “That person is uninformed on the DEI topic he is negatively speaking on, should I share my facts and references with him?” “I know I am being asked to do this because I’m Latino, but I’m literally the only Latino here and don’t have time to do the DEI work along with my real work. Can I say no? Should I say no even though I want to help others follow behind me?”

      <br / >
      <br / >
At the end of the day, my ask is the return of my bandwidth and time. I’m sure many minorities, gender, socio-economic, gender, sexual orientation and context specific, feel the same way. We just want an even playing field. We don’t want preferential treatment though, there has already been talk of <a href=" “positive discrimination” after DEI became a priority. 

      <br / >
      <br / >
I want back the bandwidth I used to try to compartmentalize. The time it took me to come to the conclusion that it was impossible to brush this off. The time it took to remember and find the sources I had read over the years for this post. The time it took to write this post. Finally, the time I will spend worrying if this post will negatively affect career prospects.
